Note: 
The site is optimized only for 150% scale on big screen devices such as laptop or monitor since windows by default scales the website 150% on 90% of laptops. So if the site look different from the design on laptop or monitor please change display scale to 150% inside windows display settings or kindly please contact me.

The styling is primarily done with CSS, with a heavy focus on custom styling due to my limited usage of Bootstrap. I may require 1 or 2 more projects to reach my full development speed and produce high-quality code.
